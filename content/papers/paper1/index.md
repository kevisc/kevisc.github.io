##### Abstract

We provide experimental evidence that using body-worn cameras (BWCs) for police monitoring improves police-citizen interactions. Dispatches with BWCs show a 61.2% decrease in police use of force and a 47.0% reduction in negative interactions, including handcuff use and arrests. The use of BWCs also improves the quality of officers’ record from the dispatches. The rate of incomplete reports dropped by 5.9%, which is accompanied by a 69% increase in the notification of domestic violence. 

We explore various mechanisms that explain why BWCs work and show that the results are consistent with the police changing their behavior in the presence of cameras. Our results stand in contrast with previous experimental literature which used coarser designs and indicated muted or null body-worn camera effects on use of force. Replicating those designs, our data also finds attenuated effects. Overall, our results show that the use of BWCs de-escalates conflicts.
